### 6. System Integration

- **Import workflow**: Files → ImportedDataRecords → Auto-processing → Separate tables
- **Frontend compatibility**: Maintained existing API contracts
- **Backward compatibility**: Old systems continue to work
- **Performance optimization**: Batch inserts and optimized queries

## 🧪 SUCCESSFUL TESTS
