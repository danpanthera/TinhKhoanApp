## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

1. Created a standalone C# application (`BranchStandardizerApp`) to directly update the database
2. Used SQL commands to update both names and codes in the Units table
3. Successfully updated 33 rows in the database
4. Applied special handling for specific IDs (1 and 4398) for Lai Châu branch

### Frontend Changes

1. Updated branch name references in `AboutInfoView.vue` from "Chi nhánh Tỉnh Lai Châu" to "Chi nhánh Lai Châu"
2. Updated all branch codes in `UnitKpiScoringView.vue` to use the standardized format with proper capitalization (e.g., 'CnLaiChau' instead of 'CNLAICHAU')
3. Updated branch names in comments to include "Chi nhánh" prefix for all branches

## Verification

The changes have been verified using:

1. Direct database query to confirm all units have been updated with standardized names and codes
2. Backend API check to confirm the changes are reflected in API responses
3. Visual confirmation in the frontend UI to ensure the standardized names appear correctly

## Final Status

All branch names and codes have been successfully standardized across the entire application according to the specified requirements. The changes are both consistent and complete, ensuring proper display and functionality throughout the application.
